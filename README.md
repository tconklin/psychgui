Constructing a GUI for a Psych Experiment
=========================================

These files are to be used for a psychology experiment testing how similar a series of images are. 240 images are broken down into 20 different sections and the goal is to compare how similar/dissimilar each section is. This is broken down into 3 separate steps; showing half of the images in quick succession, determining the similarity between each section, and determining the similarity within each section. Currently, there is only 1 attached file...a script detailing how each section behaves. Control software for the experiment (an interactive GUI) is still under development and will be uploaded by 2013-09-16
